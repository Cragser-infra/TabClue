## Data Collection

TabClue collects the following data when you click the extension icon to save your open tabs:

- **Tab URLs** and **page titles** of your open browser tabs
- **Favicon URLs** for visual identification
- **Visit frequency** (how many times a URL has been saved across sessions)

## Data Storage

All data is stored **locally** on your device using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API. No data is transmitted to any external server, cloud service, or third party.

## Data Sharing

TabClue does **not** share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties.

## Data Export

You can export all your saved data as a JSON file at any time through the Settings dialog. You can also import previously exported data to restore your sessions.

## Data Deletion

Uninstalling the extension permanently deletes all stored data. You can also delete individual tabs or entire sessions from within the dashboard.
